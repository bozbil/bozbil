### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Kahraman Kostas!
###### *PhD Candidate*


I am a second year PhD student at [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/), Edinburgh Campus. I graduated from [Marmara University](https://www.marmara.edu.tr/en) with a BSc in Computer Education and Instructional Technology in 2009. I took my MSc degree from [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/)  in Computer Networks and Security with Distinction (2018).

My master thesis was about detection of network attacks using machine learning methods. The [thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328512658_Anomaly_Detection_in_Networks_Using_Machine_Learning) and the [code](https://github.com/bozbil/Anomaly-Detection-in-Networks-Using-Machine-Learning) are available. My research interests are;

+  Computer networks
+  Internet of Things security
+  Machine learning
+  Network security


Between undergraduate and graduate education, I worked as a computer teacher for about seven years in a wide range of schools from elementary to high school in some provinces in Turkey (Ä°stanbul, ÅžÄ±rnak, Manisa, AdÄ±yaman). During these years, in addition to teaching, I worked as a technology consultant and conducted projects teaching programming to young people and encouraging teachers to use instructional technology. Between 2013 and 2016, I worked as a teacher trainer in the Fatih Project, a national project of the Turkish government, which seeks to integrate state-of-the-art computer technology into Turkey's public.

My personal interests include hiking, taking photos and Turkish literature, etymology and classical Turkish poetry (I obtained my BA in [Turkish Language and Literature](http://abp.anadolu.edu.tr/en/program/programProfili/1677/8) with Honour in 2015 )
